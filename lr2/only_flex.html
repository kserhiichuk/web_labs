                <div class="center-bottom">
                    <p>Ukraine has filed lawsuits to the World Trade Organization (WTO) against Slovakia, Poland and Hungary
                        over their bans on
                        food imports from Kyiv.</p>
                    <p>It said such restrictions were a violation of international obligations by Ukraine's EU neighbours.
                    </p>
                    <p>They say the bans are needed to protect their farmers from cheap imports.</p>
                    <p>Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year all but closed the main Black Sea shipping lanes,
                        with large grain
                        quantities ending up in central Europe.</p>
                    <p>"It is crucially important for us to prove that individual member states cannot ban imports of
                        Ukrainian goods,"
                        Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said in a statement on Monday.</p>
                    <p>"That is why we are filing lawsuits against them [Slovakia, Poland and Hungary] to the WTO."</p>
                    <p>She added that Ukrainian exporters had "already suffered and are continuing to suffer significant
                        losses" because of the
                        unilateral bans.</p>
