                <h3>'Alien bodies' presented in Congress panned as 'stunt'</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="center-bottom">
                <p>MEXICO CITY, Sept 14 (Reuters) - A UFO hearing in Mexico's congress that featured the presentation of
                    alleged remains of
                    non-human beings faced swift international backlash on Thursday, with critics labeling it a "stunt,"
                    and questions from
                    officials in Peru, where the apparent specimens first emerged.</p>
                <p>Mexican journalist and long-time UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan showed politicians at the hearing on
                    Tuesday two tiny
                    "bodies" displayed in cases, with three fingers on each hand and elongated heads. He claimed they
                    were found in Peru in
                    2017 and were not related to any life on Earth.</p>
                <p>Maussan has made similar controversial claims in the past.</p>
                <p>Similar such finds in the past have turned out to be the remains of mummified children.</p>
                <p>Peruvian Culture Minister Leslie Urteaga said no scientific institution in the South American country
                    had identified the
                    remains as non-human and questioned how the specimens had left Peru.</p>
                <p>Maussan, speaking to Reuters on Thursday, said his critics had yet to present evidence to counter his
                    claims.</p>
